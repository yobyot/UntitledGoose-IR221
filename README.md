## About

Untitled Goose Tool is a robust and flexible hunt and incident response tool that adds novel authentication and data gathering methods in order to run a full investigation against a customer’s Microsoft Entra ID, Azure, and M365 environments. Untitled Goose Tool gathers additional telemetry from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and Defender for Internet of Things (IoT) (D4IoT).

This tool was designed to assist incident response teams by exporting cloud artifacts after an incident for environments that aren't ingesting logs into a Security Information and Events Management (SIEM) or other long term solution for logs.

For more guidance on how to use Untitled Goose Tool, please see: [Untitled Goose Tool Fact Sheet](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/untitled-goose-tool-fact-sheet)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python >= 3.9 is required to run Untitled Goose Tool with Python. Python 3.12 is highly recommended as it results in better logging.

On a Windows machine, you will need to make sure to have the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable package (14.x) installed prior to running the tool.

It's also recommended to run Untitled Goose Tool within a virtual environment.

#### Mac OSX
```sh
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Linux
```sh
# You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows
```console
# You can also use py -3 -m venv .venv
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Requirements
The following EntraID/M365 permissions are required to run Untitled Goose Tool, and provide it read-only access to the tenant.

Please note: The user account should be a cloud-only account (not sync'd to the on-premise environment), this will ensure that the login process stays the same across environments for the tool.

A cloud-only user account and associated EXO service principal with the following permissions:

Exchange Online Admin Center
```
- View-Only Audit Logs
- View-Only Configuration 
- View-Only Recipients
- User Options
```

A service principal with the following permissions:

API Permissions
```
Log Analytics API
- Data.Read (Application)

Microsoft Threat Protection:
- AdvancedHunting.Read.All (Application)

WindowsDefenderATP:
- AdvancedQuery.Read.All (Application)
- Alert.Read.All (Application)
- Library.Manage (Application)
- Machine.Read.All (Application)
- SecurityRecommendation.Read.All (Application)
- Software.Read.All (Application)
- Ti.ReadWrite (Application)
- Vulnerability.Read.All (Application)

Microsoft Graph:

- RoleManagement.Read.All (Application)
- SecurityActions.Read.All (Application)
- SecurityAlert.Read.All (Application)
- SecurityEvents.Read.All (Application)

Office 365 Exchange Online
- Exchange.ManageAsApp (Application)
```

Azure Subscription IAM Roles
```
- Reader
- Storage Blob Data Reader
- Storage Queue Data Reader
```

Make sure to enable "Allow public client flows" for the service principal.

We have a [setup powershell script](scripts/Create_SP.ps1) to setup a service principal with the needed permissions. Additionally the association of the Azure Service Principal with m365 can only be done via powershell currently and is needed for some of the m365 log collection.

Below is an example of running the script which will output the `goosey conf` command you need to run to build the config files with the proper information

```powershell
PS > Write-Host "Creating a new Goose Application and Users"
PS > ./Create_SP.ps1 -AppName GooseApp -Create
```

Additionally the script can delete the Application when you are done using it
```powershell
PS > Write-Host "Creating a new Goose Application and Users"
PS > ./Create_SP.ps1 -AppName GooseApp -Delete
```

### Installing
To install, clone the repository and then do a pip install:

#### Regular Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/untitledgoosetool.git
cd untitledgoosetool
python3 -m pip install . 
```

#### Docker

```sh
docker build . -t goosey
docker run -it -v $PWD:/workdir goosey goosey honk --debug
```


## Usage
### Config

Untitled Goose Tool requires authentication parameters and configuration. To automatically build the configuration file, run the following after installation.

```sh
$ goosey conf
```

A version of this command will be generated when the powershell installation script is run to create/setup the service principal. Below is an example with fake parameter values

```sh
$ goosey conf --config_tenant=5fd146ad-8b31-4afa-a72f-6f71df5c7173 --config_subscriptionid=all --auth_appid=24fd6377-79e0-445d-838b-3eaa60d3ca21 
```

After this, `.auth`, `.conf`, `.auth_d4iot`, and `.d4iot_conf` files should be placed in your current directory. These files are used by Untitled Goose Tool. Unless this was generated with the above parameters, you should fill out the top section `[auth]` so that Untitled Goose Tool can properly auth to the appropriate resources. However, if you do not feel comfortable about entering your credentials into a file, you can opt to delete the `.auth` and/or `.auth_d4iot` and be prompted by the tool for credentials via console instead.

The barebones auth looks like:

```
[auth]
# The username of your account. ex: AAD_upn@example.onmicrosoft.com
username=
# The password of your account. ex: AAD_password
password=
# The application ID of your service principal
appid=
# The client secret value of your service principal (not the secret ID)
clientsecret=
```

The barebones config looks like:

```
[config]

[variables]
# Threshold used for ual API requests. Specifies the maximum results pulled per session. Can be between 100 - 50000. The api is optimized to return results faster the larger the threshold, but the whole session has to be repeated if an error occurs as the results are not returned sorted. We recommend 5000 as the threshold, but this can be toggled with
ual_threshold=5000
# Maximum number of ual coroutines/tasks to have running asynchronously. Minimum value is 1.
max_ual_tasks=5
# Start date for an extra time frame for ual to search. Reason for this is because ual takes the longest to pull and while you don't want the oldest data to roll off, you may want to look at another timeframe and do not want to wait for ual to get there and pull the logs. Format should be YYY-MM-DD

### Recommended Default Workflow

1. Install the tool `pip install .`
2. (Optional) Run the [setup powershell script](scripts/Create_SP.ps1) to setup the service principal for your tenant
3. Use the outputed `goosey conf` command. Or just run it with no parameters
4. Fill out the .auth file with your credentials (if you didn't use the output from the powershell script)
5. Fill out the configuration information and set wanted calls in the .conf file to `True`.
6. Run `goosey auth` with desired parameters.
7. Run `goosey honk` with desired parameters.
8. Instead of steps 6-7 run `goosey autohonk` with desired parameters

### Recommended Workflow for UAL Call

1. Steps 1-4 above
2. Open the .conf file and set `ual` under the `m365` section to `True`.
3. Run `goosey auth` with desired parameters.
4. Run `goosey honk` with desired parameters.
5. Instead of steps 3-4 run `goosey autohonk` with desired parameters

### Considerations

1. We recommend running the [setup powershell script](scripts/Create_SP.ps1) or filling out the .conf first
2. Filling out the .auth and/or .auth_d4iot is now optional.
3. Always run `goosey auth` before running `goosey honk` or `goosey d4iot`. `goosey autohonk` will perform authentication on it's own.

### Special Use Cases

#### Behind a proxy

The tool should work behind a proxy. As long as the appropriate environment variables for the cli are set
```
https_proxy=<proxy_url>
http_proxy=<proxy_url>
```

### Known Issues

1. Having `%` in the password:

    **Solution:** Make sure to escape `%` in the password with `%%`.

2. Error when attempting to `pip install .` when you are on Mac:

    ```sh
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'certifi'
    ```
    **Solution:** Go to your applications folder, find your python version folder, and double click on the file "Install Certificates.command" inside the python folder to install the certificate.

3. Why does Untitled Goose Tool return two results for Exchange Online inbox rules and Exchange Online mailbox permissions?

    **Solution:** Both the API and PowerShell calls are robust and show different information, so we decided to keep both.

4. Error after running certain Azure Security Center calls:

    Azure Compliance Results:
    ```sh
    Error: (MissingSubscription) The request did not have a subscription or a valid tenant level resource provider.
    Code: MissingSubscription
    Message: The request did not have a subscription or a valid tenant level resource provider.
    ```

    Azure Information Protection Policies:
    ```sh
    Error: Operation returned an invalid status 'Not Found'
    ```

    Azure Assessments:
    ```sh
    Discriminator source is absent or null, use base class ResourceDetails.
    ```

    Azure SubAssessments:
    ```sh
    Subtype value GeneralVulnerability has no mapping, use base class AdditionalData.
    Subtype value SqlVirtualMachineVulnerability has no mapping, use base class AdditionalData.
    ```

    **Solution:** These messages aren't issues. Azure compliance result call will still complete. The Azure information protection policy call is not a critical error. The Azure assessments call spams the console with one line warning: "Discriminator source is absent or null, use base class ResourceDetails" and will complete without an issue (besides the console spam). The Azure subassessments call spams the console with one line warning: "Subtype value GeneralVulnerability has no mapping, use base class AdditionalData." or "Subtype value SqlVirtualMachineVulnerability has no mapping, use base class AdditionalData." and will complete without an issue (besides the console spam).

5. Excessive amount of 429 errors during `goosey honk`

    **Solution:** Untitled Goose Tool will quickly encounter the Graph API limitations of a tenant; this is a limitation that Microsoft has on Graph API calls.
